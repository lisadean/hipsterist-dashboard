#Pomodoro App

A huge help to Zac Braddy w/ The Reactionary for his tutorial.  I must have replayed it 200 times and went through 20 file revisions to get mine to run.  Thank you, Zac for making it hard and challenging. :) I learned a ton!

To make this code work you'll need to run an npm install. From there it's a simple matter of running the npm start command.
